Cube framework combines knockout with bootstrap, and try to make the develope of web ui more easier.

We try to use knockout to make all ui orgnized with vvm, as well as use bootstrap to make components ui and webpage ui.

The framework folder is our frame core. Here has 2 cretical files: framework.js and WebPage.js.

We call all pages that wished to be shown WebPage, each webpage has one or more vvm.

The app_lineloss folder is just a app demo, and try to tell you how to use our framework.

At last, I have to say sorry about my poor English and the Chinese in code, We will improve our code more and more :)
